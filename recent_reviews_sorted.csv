But right now? Netflix has an opportunity to attract more subscribers if they could understand how AVP will play out. I just know that their approach needs to be rethought. Netflix has made the odd decision to limit the audio and visual quality on Apple and other devices unless you pay for its highest tier. Why, Netflix? I know you think this might incentivize me to pay you more but it only turns lots off to your whole platform. Why make those features for the highest tier? There are other ways to bring in revenue.

1175,2024-10-21 03:10:38,Started out years ago as the top streaming service because of low price and no ads. Now there are subscription tiers to get rid of ads and the need for a different subscription plan to access half of the seasons of a show or the full show outright. I wanted to watch Vikings as Netflix is the only streaming service that has it but due to my phone company paying for my plan I have ads which goes against licensing of the show so I cannot watch it unless I upgrade my plan. If I was paying for Netflix directly I would cancel my plan; but since it was a free upgrade for my phone plan I will just find the shows I want on the internet.

Most of my favorite shows are on here and that is part of the reason I have it. If you pay for a subscription every month or year I think, you can watch unlimited movies and shows for that amount of time. Some of the things on Netflix are interactive which is cool too. You can add things to your list which would be your favorite things to watch. And for traveling you can download movies to watch WITHOUT internet! There are different profiles you can set up and even a kids option so they won‚Äôt go watching stuff they are not supposed too. They show age ratings which is helpful for kids at young ages. There are so many different genres of movies like comedy, drama, horror, action and more! Something I also like is they put different movies and shows in different number places like the number one through ten of the best movies or shows that time you get on the app. This app has a great selection if your looking for some newer or older movies too.

387,2024-10-19 14:09:36,Like most people I love love loveeee Netflix but they‚Äôre deleting too many shows. An example is like total drama and this bugs me so much because they deleted total drama world tour which is the last season of gen 1. This is recent by the way and this bugs the crap out of me because they could at least keep all of gen 1 but instead they got rid of it which to this day annoys me so muchhhh. Another example is like Pok√©mon because last summer or smth we finished up the original series aka the ash series but a month or 2 ago they literally got rid of it which annoys me so freaking much because now we‚Äôre stuck with this crappy new season.

1177,2024-06-21 14:24:20,"Netflix's decision to stream ""Maharaj"" is a slap in the face to the Hindu community. This film, rife with alleged inaccuracies and disrespectful portrayals of Sanatan Dharma, prioritizes sensationalism over responsible storytelling.

Netflix's Abdication of Responsibility

Streaming giants like Netflix hold immense power in shaping cultural narratives. With ""Maharaj,"" they've chosen to prioritize profit over fostering understanding. This is not just a creative misstep; it's a blatant disregard for the millions who practice Hinduism.

Beyond Artistic Freedom

Artistic freedom doesn't exist in a vacuum. When a film misrepresents a religion as deeply ingrained as Hinduism, it has real-world consequences. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes and fosters disrespect towards a rich and vibrant culture.

What We Demand:

Accuracy, Not Sensationalism: We demand content that accurately reflects Hinduism's diverse traditions and beliefs.
Respectful Portrayals: Stop perpetuating negative stereotypes and portrayals that disrespect a religion followed by billions.
Open Communication: Engage with the Hindu community before streaming content that affects them.

My other problem I have with Netflix a lot is that every time Netflix updates on my phone, the Netflix Household problem occurs, stopping me from watching.
