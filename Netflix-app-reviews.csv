I understand they have to take some series off so they can put new ones or the ones they took off before that one back on, but how long some of the series are gone is crazy it has now almost been a whole year since ‚ÄúThe Vampire Diaries‚Äù has been off of Netflix and I am a binge watcher so I love to rewatch series and movies that I love, but a year is toooo long for me, I like to get my binge watching on and Netflix is lowkey stopping me from that, and DON‚ÄôT GET ME STARTED ON THE MOVIES, I am a fantasy, romance, drama, comedy girl, so I love movies like twilight and I do now for sure that Netflix takes that movie on and off all the time, but once again the amount of time that it gets taken off for is crazy. Me personally I think Netflix should take series on and off based off what is actually being watched by people, and if they take a series or movie off, and it‚Äôs a movie/series that people have been watching a lot they should take it off for a short amount of time (3-5 months)",4,False,Renewable series and movies,ashy ashton
1,2022-10-25 17:26:12,"I have been using Netflix for years now. It is so amazing! There are unlimited shows for all ages and show types‚Ä¶what i mean is different types of shows for different people. Action, comedy, horror, romance, family‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all there. Personally, my favorite show is Bunk‚Äôd, which would be considered comedy. I highly recommend it!!! So amazing. There are so many options.
One thing, though. There are some inappropriate shows that show up on even a kids profile. My mom still makes me use a kids profile because of all the inappropriate shows about nudity, drugs, etc and shows with swearing and stuff. It still shows up even on that profile. Just not as much. But could you please have that stuff ONLY on adult profiles? I don‚Äôt like seeing it, and I‚Äôd rather have a Watch Together profile, and still not see it much. My little siblings‚Äîwe‚Äôre talking toddlers here‚Äîsee that stuff on their profiles too. I really would like it if you didn‚Äôt have all of that.
But Netflix is mostly amazing, which is why I gave it five stars, though it was close to four stars because of the inappropriate show stuff.

I have pretty severe depression and the lack of accommodation for this disability is quite disappointing.

4,2023-04-12 01:52:51,"Oh Netflix. I will say navigation is better on mobile than a computer - on computers when you get suggested titles there‚Äôs no easy way to rate what you‚Äôve already watched and yet in both places that presents a problem within itself - if I‚Äôve already watched something I wish you would remove it from the rows of shows and movies and the better way to do this would be to have a previously rated section where all these already rated shows can live. With all the content Netflix has the cluster of what you call organization is a huge turn off and I find myself using the platform less because of it. 

Also, Netflix basically birthed the term binging so I also hate when you try to be like traditional cable and release shows by date - whoever decided this was a good idea - you don‚Äôt understand a competitive advantage when you have one as no one really likes having to tune in weekly if they also had the option of just watching all the way thru (time permitting of course).

Some things you saw before are gone but some things you didn‚Äôt see are there. People try taking advantage of this by using a vpn to make it look like they‚Äôre in another country to watch content that isn‚Äôt available in their country. But Netflix has a ‚Äúfix‚Äù. They simply set the language specifically to whatever languages are spoken in that country. But then this conflicts with people that are ACTUALLY on vacation. I‚Äôve had to watch mha in Spanish. Luckily I know Spanish but i don‚Äôt know French. I don‚Äôt know German. I don‚Äôt know Japanese. I watched season 1 of Mob Psycho 100 on the way to Switzerland and made the mistake of not downloading season 2. So now I have the options of watching it in Japanese or German.

I love Netflix SO much but, I do think it needs some work. First, I think there should be a teen section.

There are also some titles that are rated TV-MA that also don‚Äôt feature much inappropriate content that could be in the teens section. I think the teen section can feature cursing, kissing, and violence but no nudity. Second, I think you should be able to lock your profile because kids can enter the adults section very easily and watch something inappropriate. Also if you share your Netflix account with other people they can enter your account and watch shows which will then give you show recommendations that you aren‚Äôt interested in or mess up the shows your watching.

They sort of(elaborate later) keep up to date with shows that recently add new episodes or new movies that come out, though I have some concerns. First off, I think they try too hard to push their ‚ÄúNetflix original series‚Äù stuff to viewers to the point where they remove shows and movies that people like to force them into shows like paradise PD. Believe me, it was one of my favorite shows ever, but still, they take off way too many movies that people like to rewatch often like Shrek for example. As I was saying earlier about keeping up to date with new episodes and new movie releases, they tend to be very late with the additions. Even though they do still add them when the show is relevant, it‚Äôs usually not for weeks sometimes months before they come to Netflix.

Half of the shows it has for pictures on there I‚Äôve never even heard of, don‚Äôt like, or not even remotely related to my interests. I think that based on what that person watches. For example I love how to train your dragon I watch it all the time but there‚Äôs no icon pictures for that. I think based on that I watch that all the time it should automatically put a section for those icon pictures on mine that would be much better. There‚Äôs something else I don‚Äôt get.

Because I‚Äôm not into kids stuff nor nothing way too adult going on (I can handle gore btw), I think it would be better because some teens don‚Äôt like watching stuff for kids nor nothing way too inappropriate for teens to watch.
Another reason why is that the movies and shows is being cancelled and now you can‚Äôt complete like the whole series or episodes or whatever.
I don‚Äôt know why Netflix have to be expensive it could be better at the lowest $5 and the premium where you watch bonus content, uncut version of movies or more exclusive features like no advertisements at $12.

However, I recently found myself without a reliable wi-fi connection, which obliged me to stream over my LTE data connection. Much to my exasperation, I discovered that Netflix has taken the patronizing approach of disabling autoplay when streaming via cellular data. I thought at first that this irritation might be remedied by a quick trip to my account page, where the playback settings are found. However, there is just one autoplay-related checkbox, which was checked. A call to customer service confirmed that autoplay is unavailable over cellular. I feel that this policy is frankly ridiculous. With the profusion of unlimited data plans on the market, one should at least be given the option of whether to disable autoplay over data rather than have Netflix unilaterally decide the matter. I am perfectly capable of monitoring my own cellular data use; I do not need Netflix or any other company to hold my hand and choose whether I get to use cellular data.

Some of these include The Office, Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, Reign, Miraculous, How to Train Your Dragon, and others. This was the main factor in my decision because without these shows it is simply not worth my money, and I only renewed my subscription to watch Shadow and Bone, although I think I will just buy it later on Apple.

76,2024-01-11 09:19:17,"""Dear Netflix, I'm writing to express my deep appreciation for 'Midnight Gospel' and to urge you to reconsider its cancellation. The show is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends stunning visuals, thought-provoking conversations, and a unique narrative style. 'Midnight Gospel' isn't just a show; it's an experience. Duncan Trussell's interviews with various guests provide a refreshing and profound perspective on life, spirituality, and the human experience. The animation style is mesmerizing, creating a visual feast that captivates viewers from start to finish. The show has garnered a devoted fanbase who resonated with its deep, existential themes and artistic brilliance. It's not just entertainment; it's a conversation starter, a journey into the unknown realms of thought. I urge Netflix to recognize the impact 'Midnight Gospel' has had on its audience and the cultural landscape. In an era saturated with content, this show stands out as a beacon of creativity and intellectual stimulation. A second season would not only satisfy the existing fanbase but also attract new viewers eager for meaningful and visually stunning storytelling. Please, Netflix, give 'Midnight Gospel' the chance it deserves for a second season. The world needs more of this unique and groundbreaking series.

I don't understand why Netflix is doing this, because the content on the platform is one of the main reasons people are even subscribing to Netflix. Next, bringing ads to Netflix. I have heard rumors about Netflix bringing ads to their platform in early 2023, but never expected it to actually happen. Being one of the very little number of platforms that are ad free is an additional reason that Netflix is so popular. A lot of people like ad free services where they don't get interruptions in the middle of a good tv show and/or movie. I don't understand bringing ads to Netflix because feel that this would be bad for company revenue.

99,2021-07-14 15:20:42,"Netflix is not keeping up with the modern streaming world because it no longer supports AirPlay and does not integrate with the Apple TV app on iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS. By any standard, it‚Äôs a poor corporate decision to not put Netflix content in the Apple TV, where many go to discover new shows. In fact, I use Netflix less because and I often forget what shows are popular on there since there‚Äôs no Apple TV app integration. If Netflix just puts their shows on there, I guarantee there will be more traffic to their service. 

Let‚Äôs be honest, Netflix simply believes that it is a monopoly power and that people will only use their app for content, which is far from reality. Yet, Netflix‚Äôs arrogance seems to only be costly for business with the loss of major content and the noticeable downgrade in quality of its originals. It must compete with the newest streaming platforms that are here to stay by playing nice with the devices that people use to stream their content. This should only help Netflix, not hurt it.

Lately, their anti-consumer rules to prevent ‚Äúaccount sharing‚Äù comes across as a large money grab.  1st off, I paid for the 4k plan to access that content and had multiple consecutive screens at a time, I never used more than 2 and 99% of the time never more than one.  The short-sided decision to limit it further by requiring devices to be on the local Wi-Fi every month is asanine.  I have a tv inside an RV that never joins the home Wi-Fi, lives on its own network.  It‚Äôs just me, if I‚Äôm in the RV I‚Äôm not at home,if I‚Äôm home I‚Äôm not in the RV.  I‚Äôm not paying for an add on when I‚Äôm the only user.

And they never put things on there that people enjoy. They have shows that they are taking off in a few months that are really good and that a lot of people I know love! But when I recently found out that the put the ‚ÄúTHE HYPE HOUSE‚Äù on Netflix and they took off so many good shows and movies that I love.

Second, the story was obviously not ended correctly because they‚Äôre were so many unsolved stories and the ending felt rushed, the book didn‚Äôt stretch the middle of the story and rush the end making everything to happen at once. Lastly, I believe if you published a new season or maybe even two ‚ÄúAnne With An E‚Äù could be considered ‚Äúbetter than the book‚Äù because as you should know that when you publish a movie or series based off a book they always say the book is better because they‚Äôre are details, I believe this series has so much potential to become a extremely popular series because it‚Äôs very detailed.

Apple iTunes has full control over those specific things under contract terms. With majority of the consumers this is a very important factor. I personally had to learn the hard way. I followed the terms, canceled my subscription 24hrs before the billing date, and Apple iTunes still tried billing me another month. I received a email from Apple stating there was a billing issue. Shortly after I called Apple and clearly canceled 24 hrs before the billing date explaining the reason there is a billing issue.

Which is a misnomer, made in our time to only mean incredibly babying. 

As I don't wish this review to become so prolix as to hinder someone's reading of it, my final complaint will be with Netflix's ""original content,"" and to that all I can say, is whom ever let their child in the animation studio, however proud they are of their child, has no right to torment us with the child's hideous scribblings. Where is the fidelity to great animation and literary excellence anymore!?

And don't just tell me not to watch them then, for you can be reassured that I do not, I'm just afraid that if we allow this sub par material, we will soon notice that sub par has become the new standard. It's been happening for years, I'm sure because sub par is cheaper to make, and if we are sold on it as par standard we'll eat it up.",1,False,The death of intellect.,Inky Squid

I have been watching a particular series for a while, and I see that I watch all the episodes all the way to the end, yet the red line at the bottom of each episode (the one that tells you how much you have watched) keeps on cutting it short. Like the red line will infer i just started the episode, yet I have watched it twice, all the way to the end. So please fix that. Also, connection. I can have like 2/3 bars, and it will say I have internet issues. This bothers me a lot because my internet works great for many other apps, no matter how far away I am from the router.

Also, Netflix was known for being a streaming service that had absolutely no ads, but for some reason they have now decided to up the prices very high so that people are now forced to pay more for no ads even though that was why Netflix was popular in the first place. Along with this they have decided that one Netflix account/househould can only have 2 devices and I don't know what household only has 2 devices. Because of this you also have to pay more to be able to have more devices on one Netflix account that you may already pay extra for not having ads.

But me and older brother weee in high school and he figured we could watch it while at my mom's house. When the limited screen play happened, he paid for the upgrade again to get 4 screens so me, my older, brother, younger brother and himself could have our own profiles and watch wherever we ended up landing after college.

What was once a haven for uninterrupted binge-watching has transformed into a platform with intrusive commercial breaks. As a paying subscriber, it's disheartening to see the service deviate from its initial promise of an ad-free environment. The flow of a series or movie is constantly disrupted, making it harder to immerse oneself in the narrative. It feels like a step backward, reminiscent of cable TV's approach, where viewers are forced to endure advertisements despite their subscription status.

Moreover, the introduction of ads raises questions about the value of the subscription. Users expect to pay for quality content without the annoyance of commercials. Netflix's move seems to prioritize ad revenue over customer satisfaction, leading to a sense of betrayal among long-time subscribers. The shift from a premium, ad-free streaming service to one that incorporates ads undermines the very essence of what made Netflix appealing in the first place, and it leaves users questioning the direction the platform is headed.",1,False,Netflix,916_lalo

294,2020-05-27 18:05:32,"We enjoy watching Netflix via our Roku, but the iPad app is woefully deficient. 

First, the search function often does NOT work.  The app sometimes hangs, it fails to find shows that are in the Netflix catalog, and just sits there doing nothing!  In contrast, Netflix via Roku works like a charm.

The app removes notifications if you back out of that screen!  Which means that if you inadvertently tap or try to delete a single one, you've lost any list of shows Netflix claims you like.  Ah!  Turns out that going back to notifications makes them show up again ‚Äîwhy they vanished, however, is a mystery.

The tabs in the tab bar on the left side are too small, so it's too easy to hit the wrong choice.

‚Äî-> Worst of all, though, with the iPad app is that there seems to be no way of rearranging the shows in one's Watch List!

That needs fixing.  A drag-and-drop editing function would be the cat's meow!  On the web, it *seems* to have that ability, but it doesn't work!  Come on, developers, this is so basic, fix it!

By the way, Netflix's moving to thumbs up or thumbs down instead of a 5-star rating system is a MAJOR STEP BACKWARDS 

What was needed was to change the adjectives.  Several years back they offered a million dollar prize to improve their algorithm ‚Äî which, curiously, was NEVER awarded!

For example Riverdale. Riverdale only has one season out on Netflix but on like C & W there‚Äôs season 2 and I bet even the other seasons which just isn‚Äôt fair.

2. Netflix has shows and movies. Some good some bad. But mostly bad other than good it‚Äôs really hard to find a good movie or show. There isn‚Äôt even Cinderella or the classic Disney movies. Which you guys should add in all the classics. 

3. Stop taking out movies! All the movies you guys take out are good movies. All the bad movies stay on Netflix. This movie.. a great movie called The Boy In The Striped Pajamas. Which was the most sad movie I have ever watched. The most heart warming and heart breaking. It‚Äôs probably my favorite true story that ended up in a movie and it‚Äôs just not fair it got taken off of Netflix like the other good movies. It should come to an end.

The annoying auto-preview blaring sound and video when trying to scan for new programs with no option to turn it off. This slows down the UI and is constantly trying to play a preview.  If I want to see/hear a preview I will select it.  

The updated show rating system is horrible.  Previously you had a five star rating system and now they ""improved"" that to thumb-up/thumb-down only rating which offers us no way to rate a show at all.  Many of the programs I watch on Netflix just don't deserve either a thumb-up or down rather something in the middle but we have lost all of the flexibility when rating programs. This is very frustrating to me because very few programs I watch can be described to others or to the recommendation algorithm Netflix uses to determine what shows to recommend to me when I look for future programming.

I pay for the 4K tier but on most movies and shows that are added from other providers they are not being shown in 4K. Movies like the John Wick films, Aquaman, Matrix Resurrections. etc. They are only shown in HD. I This appears to be an intentional choice by Netflix. No one has ever explained why and since customer support is basically nonexistent I am leaving this review. Not that anyone at Netflix will care. Netflix pays millions of dollars to develop movies and shows you cancel after one season but you can‚Äôt stream licensed shows and movies in 4K? Maybe learn a lesson from Apple who doesn‚Äôt screw over its best subscribers.",2,False,Why no 4K on licensed movies and shows?,Gator5000e

I personally don‚Äôt want my family to cancel their subscription, but it‚Äôs a no questions kind of thing. I‚Äôm at college, they‚Äôre at home. My brother is living on his own. There‚Äôs no point in paying so much money for what other companies freely offer us with the prices we already pay. 

Funny‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt blockbuster have the opportunity to go online back in the day but they turned it down because they said it would never pick up? And funny enough wasn‚Äôt that same deal offered to Netflix and they took it and broke ground on streaming?
Don‚Äôt make the opposite mistake of Blockbuster- instead of not picking something up, maybe put something down before y‚Äôall go the same way.

1. There two sections (adults and kids) this is a easy way for you to watch your own shows and kids watch their own shows. The bad thing about kids is that there are a couple shows that have a bit of swearing In the kids section. That shouldn‚Äôt be TOO big of a problem though. Adults or teens can have their own account so they can watch what they want to. It‚Äôs free to make more profiles but there‚Äôs still a small fee to actually be able to watch Netflix.

2. The ‚ÄúAdult Section‚Äù. Now, there is the adult section and it has all shows and movies in Netflix. Now there is nudity, drugs, violence, gore, and VERY harsh language. If you are sensitive to those topics I don‚Äôt really recommend Netflix. It‚Äôs a pretty good app though in general.

3. Prices. Well, most sold that stream movies and shows you have to pay a fee. Netflix has a fee you have to pay monthly. It can get a little expensive sometimes. You can always cancel your subscription though.

I am a user of voiceover on the AppleTV and Netflix. When I show is played in 5.1 surround sound, I noticed that the split screen option no longer works. What I mean is this, if one episode of a show is going off while the credits are rolling, in the top left corner, on the bottom right corner, you would see the next episode, it‚Äôs synopsis, and what it is about. Voiceover used to work with this very very well. It no longer works at all. I have tried to contact customer service for almost 2 years and have complained about this problem. It sounds like to me in my personal opinion, that you want to lose customers. If I‚Äôm wrong, then please prove me wrong by fixing this feature. I have contacted Apple and have gone through the necessary steps to talk to them in Apple accessibility hotline. Now, the ball is in your court.

Edit: just discovered AOT/SNK and deadman wonderland and Fairy Tail were removed by Netflix. May I ask WHY?! I mean some people came here for anime and AOT is a fan favorite and on the top of everybody‚Äôs list. It needs more anime and needs the old ones back. I‚Äôm really disappointed by this!

414,2017-09-21 06:03:57,"This might seem like a petty thing, but we used to be able to rate shows and movies with a one to five star rating which would eventually tailor our Netflix recommendations to our specific viewing habits, and separate shows that we would never watch.

I know that I watch a lot of anime, but that doesn't mean I need to see every friggin' ""My Little Pony"" title staring at me each time I open the app. And just because I like Jim Gaffigan does not mean I like the comedic stylings of Chelsea Handler. If I never saw her mug on my television screen ever again, it would make me oh-so-happy!

If I could block certain titles (i.e. crap documentaries like ""life after porn"") or give a big ol' thumbs up to my favorite flicks, I'd love this app so much more. Why you took away the rating system is beyond me. Maybe to placate movie executives who were outraged at the one and a half star rating for Halle's ""Catwoman""... I don't know why, but it's a dumb decision.

Also, giving a title the ""thumbs down"" doesn't stop it from showing up in the popular section of Netflix. I am sick of scrolling by dozens of shows I have no interest in, just to find a decent flick.

(1) When you open the app, you are greeted with an advertisement‚Äîfor some show / movie that you never wanted to watch‚Äîthat covers literally 90% of your screen.  They refuse even to show you the entire icon of any other show that might be on your list; that row of icons is pushed so far down to the bottom that their bottom half is pushed off the screen.

(2) The app plays a preview‚Äîwith *sound*‚Äîof any show or movie that is highlighted.  That means that if you want silence, you should quit the app, rather than just stay where you are.

(3) The app does not care what you were just watching the last time you used it.  Ot does not put that show or movie front and center, where you can continue watching with one tap.  Instead, you have to hunt for it.

(4) The app doesn‚Äôt even order its categories (rows) in the same way from one use to the next.  Again, this forces you to hunt through its rows to find the show you were literally just watching.

(5) Netflix refuses to let Apple TV‚Äôs TV app access its data.  To watch a Netflix show, you are forced to use the Netflix app, with its problems 1-4 listed above.

However my main reasoning for coming to write this review; who writes the captions? Seriously, I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen words that are just completely wrong and out of context.

Main character‚Äôs name is Ryan, always has his name said several times typically close together in one episode but says Bryan a couple times. 
Like I said if it‚Äôs a program I get it, but if someone is actually captioning these shows they‚Äôre doing a poor job of paying attention lol..

This will never be enough reason for me to stop using Netflix I just felt that it should be said for those who never have a chance to hear and will always be like ‚Äúa phone one? What?‚Äù

453,2021-01-04 02:45:06,"First: seriously, why would you have a video app on an apple product and not have it work with airplay?

There is no point in starting to watch a show because as policy they cancel almost everything between 2-4 seasons, no matter how well loved. Don‚Äôt bother getting attached.

I‚Äôm not a fan of the majority of Netflix shows that I‚Äôve seen (most are poorly made and acted and how did they manage to ruin Arrested Development?), and the few that are good are always canceled after a few seasons no matter how popular they are, and so you are rarely able to go on a binge session with any of their shows. And now they are not holding onto any of the shows that so many of us enjoy, I guess so they can spend their money making 500 new garbage shows instead of one good one? 

the app itself is so frustrating because even if you do find something you want to watch while you‚Äôre traveling and think, ‚Äúhey! I want to use AirPlay to watch this in my hotel!‚Äù That‚Äôs too bad because apparently they are in a fight with Apple and have disabled that feature out of spite. Well, good work.

The thumbs rating only indicates ""I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE!""

The text often is thin, usually either white or yellow and has no background or outlining whatsoever.  This leads to confusing scenes where you have white text on a white background and it is quite literally impossible to read.  Some shows have had a black background behind the text, which is fine and allows readability, but I cannot understand why there is not a continuity in the quality of subtitles.

2. There really needs to be a better system to warn viewers when a show is going to be taken off. Maybe a notification or every 3 months they list the shows that‚Äôll be gone and the ones that‚Äôll be coming?

3. The My List does need to be easily organized somehow. Sometimes I want to watch a show that I‚Äôve already seen but have to search it because it takes forever to find it. Maybe a simple filing system or even alphabetical?

In the days of old, when Netflix was young,
It was a place where magic was spun.
With its red envelopes, delivered by mail,
Our movie nights were never to fail.

No streaming, no buffering, just pure delight,
As we eagerly awaited the flicks of the night.
Endless choices, classics and more,
We could binge-watch like never before.

No autoplay, no pressure to move on fast,
We took our time, savoring each show that would last.
We didn't need algorithms to curate our view,
We trusted our instincts, knew what to pursue.

We'd browse through genres, explore with glee,
Discovering hidden gems for you and me.
The queue was a treasure trove, carefully crafted,
Filled with cinematic wonders that we relished.

No skip intro button, no instant recommendations,
We appreciated the anticipation, the well-earned sensations.
We embraced the waiting, the buildup of suspense,
Each episode savored, no rushing, no pretense.

Oh, Netflix of old, how we yearn for those days,
The simplicity, the joy, the nostalgic ways.
But even as things change, we hold onto the past,
Remembering the moments that were oh so vast.

So let us recall, with fondness and cheer,
The old Netflix, a time we hold dear.
For in those memories, we find solace and might,
And though things have changed, the magic's still bright.",1,False,Old Netflix,logy1canoby

Unfortunately, the recent changes have made this nearly impossible.

Despite paying for the highest-tier subscription, I am constantly faced with barriers when trying to access content away from my 'home' location. This not only undermines the value of the Premium UltraHD plan but also shows a lack of consideration for customers like myself who are often on the move due to professional commitments.

I understand the need for regulations to prevent misuse of services, but this one-size-fits-all approach is incredibly restrictive and unfair to legitimate users. It's disheartening to see a service I've supported for years become so inaccessible and user-unfriendly, especially for those of us who travel frequently.

First, they ruined one of our favorite shows. What started out as a good fun family friendly show for the first two seasons suddenly got loaded with cursing and sexual jokes in season 3. We turned it off mid way through the first episode.

Second, it was becoming increasingly difficult to find any good movies that we even cared to watch. We would sometimes spend up to an hour or more just browsing through trying to find anything interesting.

Third, and this was the final deal breaker for us, was when they started releasing movies that directly attacked our Christian faith in how they portrayed Jesus.

We decided to return to Netflix just briefly for the holidays to enjoy a few of the Christmas movies and just in this short time, they have already removed one of the movies that made us want to reactivate our account and I have also been disgusted to see the amount of outright pornographic movies they have added.

make an option to always skip intro. whether thats a pop up or in a settings, there should be an option to always skip the intro. and if youre wondering; ""well what if i wanted to watch it that time?"" then go back and watch it. then maybe for the rest of the show it doesnt skip the intro. simple as that.",3,False,an annoying feature.,Walgreenphotoappisawasteoftime

1177,2024-06-21 14:24:20,"Netflix's decision to stream ""Maharaj"" is a slap in the face to the Hindu community. This film, rife with alleged inaccuracies and disrespectful portrayals of Sanatan Dharma, prioritizes sensationalism over responsible storytelling.

Netflix's Abdication of Responsibility

Streaming giants like Netflix hold immense power in shaping cultural narratives. With ""Maharaj,"" they've chosen to prioritize profit over fostering understanding. This is not just a creative misstep; it's a blatant disregard for the millions who practice Hinduism.

Beyond Artistic Freedom

Artistic freedom doesn't exist in a vacuum. When a film misrepresents a religion as deeply ingrained as Hinduism, it has real-world consequences. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes and fosters disrespect towards a rich and vibrant culture.

What We Demand:

Accuracy, Not Sensationalism: We demand content that accurately reflects Hinduism's diverse traditions and beliefs.
Respectful Portrayals: Stop perpetuating negative stereotypes and portrayals that disrespect a religion followed by billions.
Open Communication: Engage with the Hindu community before streaming content that affects them.

Netflix's new household pricing scheme is not just stupid; it's downright disrespectful to loyal customers who have supported the platform for years. Now, instead of enjoying quality time together watching our favorite shows, I'm forced to make the heartbreaking decision of who deserves access to Netflix in my family.

Forcing families to choose between their children, elderly parents, and themselves is not just unfair‚Äîit's cruel. As a provider, it's agonizing to prioritize one family member's entertainment over another's, especially when all they want is to relax and enjoy some downtime together.

Netflix needs to reconsider their pricing strategy and remember the families who helped build their empire.

There is 2 settings, kid and adult which are very different.
Kids have coco melon and that jazz when adults have good shows. 
I think there should be a new setting called tween. It‚Äôs in the middle of kids and adult. Tween should have PG-13 stuff but not adult stuff. That way 10 years olds and 9 year olds and 11 year olds can actually enjoy Netflix. Shows like Cobra Kai or (non related adult stuff) would fit. That way 11 year olds are not stuck with cocomelon and princesses and can watch Netflix. If you don‚Äôt know, about all tweens know swear words so there are no problems with adding that stuff.

1858,2022-01-15 12:30:59,"Netflix has made it their goal to transform remakes of old classics into those that feature trans and homosexual characters, going as far as inserting them even into children's shows where sexuality is not even mentioned or detailed prior. This is a deliberate attempt to ruin the good character of your families with sexual deviation and bad practices. I do not doubt their are good homosexual and trans people in this world, but they would not go into the houses of children and try to force them into being homosexual or trans as Netflix does. This is on par with sexual abuse. If anyone went into a child‚Äôs home to try to convince them to be overly sexualized at an early age, it would be a criminal sentence.

I just can‚Äôt watch content w/ English dubbed voices or subtitles. I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs so disappointing for me...good for the show‚Äôs language viewers...to see awesome looking shows then find out they‚Äôre not in English.
